A factory method is a design pattern in object-oriented-programming where you provide a method
to create objects instead of calling a constructor directly.
It's a part of Factory Method Pattern.

What is it?
A method that returns an instance of a class (or interface) without exposing the creation logic
to the client.

The client calls the factory method, and the factory decides which class to instantiate or how to
configure.


Why use factory methods?
1) Encapsulation of object creation
2) Flexibility
3) Immutability or constraints
4) Improved readability


Factory Method Pattern Vs Constructor
-Constructor: Always creates the same class.
-Factory Method: Can decide which class to create, apply validations, caching or return pre-built objects.
